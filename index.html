            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>1. What is Photos to PDF Converter?</h3>
            <p>Photos to PDF Converter is a simple and secure offline app that lets you convert your photos into PDF files directly on your device without an internet connection.</p>

            <h3>2. Does the app collect or store any personal data?</h3>
            <p>No. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data. All processing happens locally on your device.</p>

            <h3>3. How does the photo-to-PDF conversion work?</h3>
            <p>All selected photos are processed entirely offline. The generated PDF files remain on your device and are never uploaded to any server.</p>

            <h3>4. Why does the app need media access?</h3>
            <p>We request access to your photo library or storage only so you can select images to convert and save the resulting PDFs. Your files remain private and never leave your device.</p>

            <h3>5. Are there any in-app purchases?</h3>
            <p>Some premium features may be available via in-app purchases handled securely through the App Store. We donâ€™t handle or store any payment information ourselves.</p>

            <h3>6. Is an internet connection required?</h3>
            <p>No. The app works entirely offline, so you can convert your photos to PDFs anytime, anywhere without needing internet access.</p>
